# EcuaexoticsFrontend - Angular Fruit Export Traceability App

## Project Description

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.14.

This is an Angular application designed to facilitate the traceability process for a pitahaya export company. The application allows users to track the entire journey of the fruit, starting from the arrival of trucks at the packaging facility, through the cleaning and calibration process, to the packaging of the fruit in various presentations such as 2.5kg, 4.5kg, 12.7kg, etc. It also enables users to register the palletization process of the boxes before shipping them via air or sea to different parts of the world.

Key Features

- Truck Registration: Register the arrival of trucks at the packaging facility, including relevant details such as truck number, driver information, and arrival time.
- Cleaning and Calibration: Track the cleaning and calibration process of the fruit, ensuring adherence to quality standards and regulations.
- Packaging: Record the packaging of the fruit in different presentations, capturing information such as packaging type, weight, and labeling.
- Palletization: Manage the palletization process, including the arrangement of boxes on pallets and preparation for shipment.
- International Shipment: Track the transportation of pallets via air or sea to various destinations worldwide.
- User Roles: The system supports four types of users, including three operators responsible for different stages of the process and an administrator with overall system management privileges.
- Document Generation: Generate documents related to the fruit processing and packaging workflow, providing comprehensive records and compliance documentation.
